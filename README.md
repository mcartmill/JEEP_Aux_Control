# JEEP_Aux_Control
Control for aux accessories like additional lighting using a touchscreen control.

Goal

I am creating an open source solution to controlling additional electronic components such as lights.  

Conditions:
1.    Must be stand alone, not connecting to existing systems of the Jeep.
2.    Easy to customize
3.    Low Cost
4.    All documents available for anyone to use (code, PCB files, GRB files)
5.    Allow others to add to the documentation for functionality and defects


MCU Code

Code uses Ardiuno code for ease of use.


Touchscreen Code
